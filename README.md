# Start your own "Can of Books" App

This repository has starter code to begin work on creating your own online bookshelf.

## What can books do?

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

## Use this template

Clone this repo to your own account with the green "Use this template" button. Then, add any collaborators. Now you are ready to start adding features! Deploy your site to let the world know which books have had the greatest impact on you, and what's recommended. Enjoy!

# Project Name

**Author**: Jaye Rhinehart and KP Gomez

**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Estimates
<!-- See below -->

## Credit and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->

## Collaboration

### Logistical

What hours will you be available to communicate? 

- Jaye's hours after 3 p.m. to 10 p.m. PST
- KP's hours as early as 2 p.m. no later than 3:30 p.m. start to 10 p.m. PST

What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

- Slack

How often will you take breaks?

- 15 minutes after every 45 minutes of lab

What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

- Meet before class starts sometime after 3:30 p.m. to figure out plan of action to catch-up or help each other find blockers

### Cooperative
Make a list of each parson’s strengths.

- Jaye's strength is high attention to detail
- KP's strength is creativity

How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

- Jaye's strength would help find logic and syntax errors so there will be less bugs and KP's strength would help make the application more interesting

In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength? 

- KP wants to practice her problem solving skills and Jaye would like a greater strength in coding as well as problem solving

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

- Talk through it and comments in the code

### Conflict Resolution

What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

- Communicate and be nice.

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

- Communicate and be nice.

How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

- Ask questions
